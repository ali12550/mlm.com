                    <strong>&nbsp;Investment on this platform opens a three-level generation model. The third level
                        means
                        that the agent can get the commission share of the third level, and the part that exceeds the
                        third level can not get the commission share. For example, if you are a member A of this
                        platform, you will have the agency right after you perform the task of purchasing. The system
                        will automatically form your member center and promote the exclusive QR code. Share your
                        exclusive QR code by yourself. B will register as a member by scanning the QR code. After
                        performing the purchasing task, A will get Bâ€™s commission 20%.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the system will automatically form B's member center and
                        exclusive QR code. C registered as a member by scanning the QR code, and after performing the
                        purchasing task, B will receive 20% of C's commission. A gets 10% of C; and so on, if D becomes
                        a member through C, C gets 20%, B gets 10%, and A gets 5%.</strong>
